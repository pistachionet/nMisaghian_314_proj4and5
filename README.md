# 314 Project 4&5 

In this project you collect a dataset (anonymous questionnaire) and share it to be publicly available.

 

 

 

Ask 10 people these questions:

Q1: There is widespread mental health epidemics, problems such as depression and anxiety and many more. But WHY? In our opinion, what is the leading cause and what is the second-leading cause of this collective increase? For each of them can you briefly mention how that factor leads to a mental health problem?

Q2: What is your favorite thing about the modern human life, what is your second-favorite thing, and what is your least-favorite thing?

Q3: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of mothers specifically.

Q4: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of fathers specifically. 

Q5: name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of children specifically. 

 

 

Then prepare a dataset with 10 rows (besides the header row on the top which has the column names), with the following columns:

1) age of respondent

2) gender (optional)

3) years of formal education completed, starting from first year of elementary school (technical/vocational schools also count, and for homeschooled person, just write their own subjective equivalent)

4) suggested leading cause in Q1 (in less than 3 words)

5) suggested second-leading cause in Q1 (in less than 3 words)

6) suggested mechanism (answer to the "how" question in Q1) for leading cause in Q1 (insert fully, don't summarize)

7) suggested mechanism for second-leading cause in Q1 (in full)

8) favorite modern feature in Q2

9) second favorite modern feature in Q2

10) least favorite modern feature in Q2

11) mother-specific factor

12) father-specific factor

13) child-specific factor

 

Here are the column names:

1) age

2) gender

3) education

4) mental_illbeing_cause_1

5) mental_illbeing_cause_2

6) mental_illbeing_mechanism_1

7) mental_illbeing_mechanism_2

8) favorite_modern_feature_1

9) favorite_modern_feature_2

10) favorite_modern_feature_3

11) mothers_specific

12) fathers_specific

13) children_specific

 

(job market advice: in professional settings, avoid using space in naming things, such as column titles or files or folders where your data or code is stored in, and put "_" or other valid characters instead of space. This will prevent many coding errors and a big help

 

 

Save your dataset, which has 13 columns and 11 rows (one header row and 10 rows for 10 respondents), as a csv file.

 

 

Then you must share your data publicly on the GitHub repository. Read this brief instruction manual Download this brief instruction manual(or you can easily search on the web). upload your dataset on Github, and add a readme file and briefly explain what this dataset is.

 

On ELMS, submit your csv file, a the link to your GitHub repository.
